Q. In medical microbiology if you have a purity plate of salmonella, E. coli 
& Klebsiell, how to differentiate between them and find pathogenic microbe? 

*This result means on the antibiotic bench the vitek ID is not pure after it was loaded 
for biochemical ID. 
*I would view the calibration / QC records of VITEK card for anIdent kit if QC has passed.
*I would check QC record of saline used to make 0.5 McFarland suspension of colony.
* The enterofaecal specimen has those three microbes as commensals besides salmonella.
(site of infection). I would check site of infection to see what is likely.
* Check previous results on iLab with latex agglutination testing to see what progress
has been made. 
*I would restreak the purity plate with another colony that does not ferment lactorse NLF
to test for Salmonella. 
*Conclusion: Resubculture onto fresh suitable agar & incubate for 18-24 hours.
