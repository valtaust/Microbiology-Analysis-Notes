* check collection date and transport date
* type of specimen collection 
* e.g. Veterinary collection as a free catch sample 
* If 5 colonies on agar plate then sampling
of specimen received contamination by skin
commensal microbes. 
* best action to take is to ask for a 
fresh specimen
* which of those 5 agar plate colonies are 
pathogenic or infectious to the patient. 
Conserve lab resources for a resample.
