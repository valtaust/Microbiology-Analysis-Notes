A clean mid-stream specimen is essential. In urinary tract infections (UTI) the bacterial count exceeds 100,000 organisms/ml in the majority of cases.
4'C storage temperature
If delay reaching lab > 2 hours refridgerate (beaware it is hard to grow some microbes if fastidious from cold temperature, before culture, leave out the
sample to bring to room temp)

-----------------------------------------------
Different types of collection methods
* Midstream urine msu
* catheter stream
* BSU for infants
cytoscopy seems a rare method but available

Microscopy:
White cell count: Normal range 0-10 / cmm
Red cell count: Normally absent
Comment on the presence of epithelial cells, crystals, yeast

Escherichia coli strains are the most common isolate, founded in 80%of the urine samples of patients with a simple UTI (cystitis), 
followed by Staphylococcus saprophyticus (5-15%), whereas Klebsiella, Enterobacter or Proteus rarely cause infection outside the hospital (5- 10%)
